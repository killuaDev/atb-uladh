# 6 Pronouns
A lot of things influence the pronunciation of the personal pronouns in Ulster Irish. To display all the changes, we have to look at the usage of the pronouns in the following types of sentences.
- (a) Unstressed in normal sentence
- (b) Stressed in sentences
- (c) In contrastive sentences

## 6.1 Unstressed pronouns
The following is the system based on spelling. The standard spelling is given first, then a dialectal spelling in parentheses giving information about the pronunciation when they're unstressed. The phonetic spelling will only be given when the pronunciation cannot be clearly expressed through the spelling. The symbol /ə/ expresses a vowel like the English *a* in ***a**bove*, **a**round.
- *mé (me, mea, /m´ə/)*
- *tú (tu(w)), thú (hu(w))*
- *sé (se, sea, /s´e/), é (é, ea, /ə/)*
- *sí (si, i), í (i)*
- *sinn, muid/-mid*
- *sibh*
- *siad (si(o)d)*
- *iad (yi(o)d)*

The following are sentences where the pronouns are said as laid out above. They're unstressed.
- *Chan fhaca sé Pádraig. (sea, s´ə)*
- *Bhuail siad an mac. (si(o)d)*
- *Fuair mé carr úr. (mea, m´ə)*
- *D'imigh sí go Meiriceá. (dime si)*

### Notes
*Muid* is used as an analytic pronoun, it's hard to show the pronunciation without using phonetic symbols, but it's a similar vowel to the *o* in *bomaite, (ar) son* etc. *-mid* is a synthetic form which is connected to the stem of the verb. The *m* in the ending *-mid* can be broad or slender.

Remember that the short vowel *i* in the pronouns *sí* and *í* in Ulster Irish has the quality of *ee* in the English *need*.

## 6.2 Pronouns in phrases
When pronouns are in phrases with *sin, seo, siúd* and *féin*, they are entirely unstressed. The strongest stress is on *sin, seo* etc.
- *Seán é féin a bhí ann. **(a)***
- *Iad sin is ciontaí leis. **(yi(o)d)***
- *An bhfuil sí seo a dhíth ort? **(si)***
- *Tú féin a dúirt é. **(tu)***

## 6.3 Stressed forms
The following is the system based on spelling. The long vowels and the diphthong *ia* aren't shortened.
- *mé*
- *tú, thú*
- *sé, sí, é, í*
- *sinn, muid/mid*
- *sibh*
- *siad, iad*

### 6.3.1 Emphasising an answer
The following are the contexts where stressed pronouns are used. The strongly stressed words are in bold. These phrases have a special meaning and they make some clarification or correction to the person who asked the question.
- *An raibh tú ann? (tu(w)) - Is **mé** a bhí. **('smé)***
- *Ní bheidh siad ann? (si(o)d) - **Beidh siad. (béi siad)***
- *Níl sí fiche bliain an bhfuil? (si) - **Tá sí** leoga agus cúig bliaina is fiche. **(Tá sí)***

### 6.3.2 Emphasising the verb
Note the difference between the pairs below. The pronouns in the first sentence of each pair are unstressed, but in the second sentence in each case the pronoun in bold is stressed. When the pronouns are unstressed, normal information is being given. When the second pronoun is emphasised, whatever opinion the last person gave is being 'corrected'.

|                                        |                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| *Chan fhaca sé mé. (sea mea, s´ə mea)* | *Chan fhaca sé **mé**. (sea **mé**, s´ə **mé**)* |
| *Dhíol sé í. (sea i)*                  | *Dhíol sé **í**. (sea **í**, s´ə **í**)*         |
| *Chuala siad mé. (si(o)d mea)*         | *Chuala siad **mé**. (si(o)d **mé**)*            |
| *Thug mé liom é. (ea)*                 | *Thug mé liom **é**. **(é)***                    | 

### 6.3.3 Pronouns right after *agus/ach* in a clause
In the sentences below there's little stress put on the first pronoun but there's a strong stress on the pronoun in **bold**.
- *Tháinig sí agus **í** fliuch báite. (si, **í**)*
- *Chonaic Síle iad agus **iad** ag teacht ón aonach. (yi(o)d, **iad**)*
- *Tiocfaidh sé ach **tú** labhairt leis in am. (sea, **tú**)*

### 6.3.4 Pronouns with the copula
The pronouns used after the copula are stressed.
- *Más **í** Máire atá ann beidh sí isteach gan mhoill. (má **sí**, si)*
- *Cé Pádraig? Is **é** Pádraig an gréasaí. **('sé)***
- *An **tú** a bhí ann?** Is **mé**. (**tú, 'smé**)*

## 6.4 Emphatic forms of the pronouns
These emphatic forms are used in normal sentences and are not particularly stressed, The following are the emphatic forms for each person. There's always a strong stress on the first syllable of these forms usually which means that no reducing happens to the diphthong *ia* in *(s)iadsan*. In the word *muidinne* the second syllable is stressed.
- *mise*
- *tusa, thusa*
- *seisean, eisean*
- *sise, ise*
- *muid**inn**e, sinne*
- *sibhse, shibhse*
- *siadsan, iadsan*

- *Rachaidh mise síos.*
- *Iadsan a ba chiontaí leis an troid.*
- *Dúirt seisean guir muid**inn**e a ghoid an t-airgead.*
- *Bígí sibhse/shibhsethíos roimhe.*

### 6.4.1 The forms *thú/thusa* etc.
The forms above are used in the following cases.
- (a) when they are the object in a sentence, and
- (b) when they come after a verb in the Imperative Mood

There is often variation between *tú/thú* and *tusa/thusa* when they're the object of the sentence.
- *Chonaic na páistí tú/thú*
- *Má chuireann sé tusa/thusa chun an tsiopa ná gabh.*

*Thusa* is what's used most, rather than the suffix *-sa* after 2nd Person Singular, Conditional
- *Dá mbuailfeá thusa do bhuille in am bhí leat.*
- *Dá rachfá thusa siar nuair a hiarradh ort é gheofá an t-airgead.*

#### Note
It's clear however that *thú/thusa* is an object form. That much is very clear from the sentences beow. The second sentence in each case only has one meaning - that is that the first person mentioned does the action. The first sentences are ambiguous because it could be the first person doing the action, or the person referred to by *tú/tusa*.

|                             |                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| *Cé a chonaic tú?*          | *Cé a chonaic thú?*          |
| *Cén fear a shábháil tusa?* | *Cén fear a shábháil thusa?* |
